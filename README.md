# social-network-api

The Social Network API is a back-end application that uses a NoSQL database to provide routes to manage unstructured data. When the application is invoked (using 'npm start' in the command line), the server is started and Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB databse. User can test routes in Insomnia Core for users, thoughts, friends of users, and reactions to thoughts.
